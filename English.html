      <p>There are many things that had effrects on teh precolonial period, but perhaps teh most important was the early americans' search for the three G's. Incase you don't know the thre g's are God, gold, and glory. However when talkign about what shapped the precolonal times one of the three G's stnad out moe than the rest. The G i am refering too is God. If we look at the earliest american colony of jamestown we can see how true this is. The enitre reason that jamestown was created is so that the new settlers could convert the natives to christianity. The settlers were also trying to keep other religions from spreading in the new land. There were also glory and gold aspects in the reasoning for settling in america. The first settlers wanted the glory of being the first to succesfully come to the new land and start a colony. The settlers were also looking for profitable new crops andother things they would be able to bring back and sell too make money.The three G's all played a very big role in the precolonial times of our country but perhaps some playe a bigger role than others.
